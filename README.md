# Situation Awareness Project
## Group 6
The objective of this project is to implement a comprehensive e-learning system designed to assist
users in tailoring their learning pathways and enhancing their skill sets. Developed with a strong
emphasis on situational awareness, this project is structured into two primary components: the
first involves Goal-Driven Task Analysis (GDTA), and the second focuses on the implementation
of an integrated dashboard.
