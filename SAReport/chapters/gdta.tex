We applied the \textit{Cognitive Task Analysis} (CTA) methodology to explore individuals' knowledge and thought processes. Among the various CTA methodologies available, we selected the \textit{Goal-Directed Task Analysis} (GDTA), specifically focusing on Situation Awareness (SA) and the goals inherent in SA processes. 

\section{Initial GDTA Goal Tree}
The initial GDTA Goal Tree, shown in Figure 4.1, identified three Major-Goals. However, after an in-depth review and analysis, we concluded that the Major-Goal 1 \textbf{"Identify prior knowledge in the field of Cybersecurity"} can be integrated into the Major-Goal 2 \textbf{"Define and evaluate the knowledge required for Offensive Cybersecurity by monitoring students' progress"}. This conclusion was drawn from a comprehensive analysis of the sub-goals associated with Major-Goal 1.

Furthermore, the sub-goals of Major-Goal 1 have been reclassified as Level 2 elements, signifying their importance in the comprehension phase of the learning process.

In Figure 4.2, we present our Final GDTA Goal Tree, which outlines the primary goals of the system and the sub-goals that contribute to their achievement. In particular, our GDTA Goal Tree supports users in adapting their learning paths to enhance their expertise in Offensive Cybersecurity.
The \textit{Overall Operator Goal} is broken down into two primary \textit{Major Goals} as shown in the picture below. Each Major Goal is further divided into \textit{SubGoals} that are essential for achieving the Major Goals.

\section{Major Goal 2.1: Ensure course optimization to maximize learning outcomes}
This Major-Goal aims to make the platform more engaging and effective for users. It focuses on two main things: boosting how users interact with the platform and making studying more personalized based on how each user learns.

To achieve this, the platform will track how users use it—what they are interested in, what skills they have, and where they might need help. With this info, the platform can adjust how it works to match each user's progress and preferences. 

\subsection{Sub-Goal 1.2.1: Improve student engagement with the platform}
The objective of improving student engagement with the platform focuses on increasing and enhancing student interactions. Key metrics include session length, number of active users, days spent on module, forum activity (questions and answers) and the engagement level with the platform. The analysis of these data involve user's session length compared with the length of other users session, a comparison between the days spent on a module by students, and student interaction within the forum. Ultimately, the goal is to prevent student dropout by understanding and addressing engagement factors.
