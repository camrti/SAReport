The dataset used to create the mockup of the dashboards has been handcrafted by the authors.
It is made of different CSV files, each one representing a table. These files have been descrive
the courses within an e-learning platform, the interactions between a user and courses,
the interactions between users, the resources used by the user on the platform, and the result
of a user in the courses.

The dataset is composed of the following tables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
        \textbf{Completed Course:} This table expresses if the user has completed something each 
        day or not for the different courses;
    \item 
        \textbf{User Hours Sessions:} This table represents the hours spent by the user on the platform 
        each day and the average hours spent by the other users;
    \item 
        \textbf{Resources:} This table represents the hours of use of the different resources that are
        within the platform for each day;
    \item 
        \textbf{Forum:} This table represents the interactions between users on the forum, showing the number
        of questions asked, the number of answers given, and the number of answers received;
    \item 
        \textbf{Completed Modules Votes:} This table expresses the votes obtained by the user for each module completed, 
        for each type (theory or exercise).
\end{itemize}

The data are shown on a time slice of twenty days, from the first of May to the twentieth of May. The reason of 
this time interval is to show the learning situation of the user on the platform before the end of the courses,
which is set on the last day of May.
