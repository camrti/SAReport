The objective of this project is to implement a comprehensive e-learning system designed to assist users 
in tailoring their learning pathways and enhancing their skill sets. This project is structured into two primary components: the first involves the \textit{Goal-Driven Task Analysis} (GDTA), and the second focuses on the implementation of an integrated dashboard.

This system is meticulously crafted with a \textbf{User-Centric Approach}, ensuring that users can effectively 
monitor their competencies and track their learning progress. Before developing the GDTA, we delineated operational 
concepts through detailed personas and scenario analysis, ensuring that the system is aligned to the diverse needs 
and contexts of its users. To fulfill the goals described inside the GDTA, we implemented two dashboards: the first
dashboard is focused on the user's global learning progress, while the second dashboard is focused on the user's
progression in a specific course.

For the dashboard implementations, we leveraged \textit{ElasticSearch} as the underlying database and \textit{Kibana} 
as the visualization tool. 

Initially, it was intended to conduct a comprehensive data analysis using an extensive dataset found online. However, 
we faced significant challenges in finding data that aligned perfectly with our needs. Consequently, we 
chose to create our own .csv files containing the essential data required to populate our dashboard. The data 
are shown on a time slice of 20 days, from May 1st to May 20th. The reason for 
this time interval is to illustrate the user's learning situation on the platform before the end of the courses,
which is set for the last day of May.
